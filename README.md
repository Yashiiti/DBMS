To computerize the actions of employees, make hotel booking easier(using third party sites costs the hotel),record data about the functioning of the hotel,which can be analysed to improve operational efficiency of the hotel in the future.
We have done our best to use structured and modular architecture, and other techniques to simplify the complex process of designing and developing a web-based hotel management system. This project is used by two kinds of user :
i) Online user
ii) Mangement and Staff of Hotel

We need a database and website for managing a hotel.The following features are needed:

1.We need to maintain details of the guests and staff
2. For the staff,details such as the salary,name,designation,etc of the staff are needed.
3.For guests details like phone number will be taken,keeping their privacy in view we will not save aadhar or other more personal details in the database the staff will simply check the id proof while checking them in.
3.We need to make a services form so that guests can easily order room service and register any complaint.
4.The website should look attractive and  easily accessible.It will be  used by people to book a room,a table at our restaurant or a hall for different kinds of events
5.The staff should also be able to easily check-in the guests using a front end,they will not directly access the database.
